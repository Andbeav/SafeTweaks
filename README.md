# SafeTweaks

QOL tweaks that should be safe for servers. Think [Tweakeroo](https://github.com/maruohon/tweakeroo) without the 'hacky' features.

## Requirements

* [ModMenu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu)
* [ClothConfig](https://github.com/shedaniel/cloth-config)

## Current tweaks

* Gamma override
* Render distance fog override

## Usage

Assuming you have the required mods, the Mod menu button on the main/pause screen should list SafeTweaks and the given options.
